Whether you are a developer, designer, translator, or just a regular user, there are many ways to contribute to Papyros.

#### Funding

Papyros currently has no commercial funding, and development is done by team members and third-party contributors in their spare time. With continual funding, the Papyros team will be able to dedicate more time to working on Papyros as well as pay third-party contributors to work on features and bugs through the use of bug bounties. This will allow me, Michael Spencer, to spend more time as the lead developer building new features of the OS, getting the alpha ready for testing, and working towards stable releases of the operating system. It will also encourage more third-party contributors to get involved with development of the OS.

      Bountysource puts funds directly in the hands of developers by rewarding them for committing fixes or creating new features. Set a bounty on the issues that matter to you most or fund a specific app or project. You can also set up a recurring subscription. <a href="https://github.com/bountysource/frontend/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">Learn more <i class="mdi-navigation-chevron-right" style="vertical-align: -6%"></i></a>

#### Development

 * If you're familiar with QML, you can contribute to our
   [Material Design app framework](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) or the
   [desktop shell](https://github.com/papyros/papyros-shell) itself.
 * If you prefer C++, you can help by implementing backends for the desktop shell indicators and
   other features in the [desktop library](https://github.com/papyros/qml-desktop)
 * If you want to help build the base operating system, including work on using OSTree and xdg-app,
   check out the [powerpack](https://github.com/papyros/powerpack) repository.

#### Translations

The project is still in active development, and doesn't fully support translating yet. We'll add
support for translations, and would love to have your help!

#### Design

We care a lot about the design of Papyros. You can check out our [mockups](https://github.com/papyros/mockups),
or join the discusson in the Papyros community on Google+ by submitting mockups or commenting on
others' mockups.

#### Bug Reports

Once we have an alpha release, bug reports are a great way to contribute to Papyros, whether you're
a developer, designer, or tester. We plan to have a bug reporting app in the OS, but you can also
file bugs in the appropriate project on [GitHub](https://github.com/papyros).
